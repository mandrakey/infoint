# Exercise collection Information integration
This repository contains code created for solving exercises during the course
"Information Integration" at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin.

The languages used include
* Java 7
* Python
* C++
* Ruby

**Disclaimer**: Most of the code is not properly commented and was not designed
to be aesthetically pleasing. The main goal was to solve the exercise, so bear
with me.

The exercises can be found on the webpages of the Department of Computer
Science, Knowledge Management in Bioinformatics at the HU Berlin:
